#### Regional processes dominate microbial community assembly in the phyllosphere of four wetland plant species

This repository contains the R script, the data, and the RDS files required for the analyses associated with the phyllosphere project from our lab. In this project, we investigate the relative contribution of local and regional processes in microbial community assembly in the phyllosphere of wetland plants. The repository contains a zip folder called phyllosphere.zip. In this folder, you will find the R script and the csv metadata, as well as two folders, called phyllosphere_16S and phyllosphere_ITS. These folders contain all the RDS files and other files required to run the bacterial and fungal analyses, respectively. The metagenomic sequences have been deposited on NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (BioProject ID: PRJNA962993) and can be obtained here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA962993.
